  <p class="p3"> Robert Pattinson was born in London, England in 1986, and began acting at the age of 15, in stage plays such as 'Guys and Dolls'.
    In 2008, Pattinson was cast in blockbuster hit ‘Twilight’ as Edward Cullen.
    After his success and newly acclaimed fame from the Twilight film series, Pattinson went back to his roots, and to what inspired him to become an actor in the first place;
    his love for high-quality cinema, starring in independent projects with auteur directors, such as Benny and Josh Safdie in ‘Good Time’, and now with Robert Eggers in ‘The Lighthouse’. </p>
