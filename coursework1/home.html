<h2> SYNOPSIS </h2>

<!-- I wrote the synopsis myself, in order to show orgiginality withtin my project-->

<p class="p1">

In 1890â€™s America, A grizzled veteran lighthouse keeper (Willem Dafoe), and a lumberjack turned rookie lighthouse keeper (Robert Pattinson)
are isolated together off the shore of New England on a job; their sanity begins to slip away, as they descend into madness, unsure of what is real and what isn't.
How long have they been there? How long until they crack?
